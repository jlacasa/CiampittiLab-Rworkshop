## Motivation  



### What is tidy data?  
All tidy data have the same structure:  

* Each variable has its own column.  
* Each observation must has own row.  
* Each value must hass own cell.  

> It allows Râ€™s vectorised nature to shine. Remember the `mutate` and `summary` functions, most built-in R functions work with vectors of values.  

## Data Organization in Spreadsheets  
(paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) )  
**Take-home messages:**  

* Be consistent  

* Choose good names   
  "weight" $\neq$ "weight` `", etc.  

* Dates as YYYY-MM-DD  

* No empty cells  
  For missing data, write "99" or "NA", etc.  

* Just one thing per cell  

* Create a data dictionary  

* Do not use font/cell color as data

# Kahoot  

# So... what do you do if you don't have tidy data?  

## Different (real-world) examples of untidy data  

## What' would you change's wrong?      
```{r untidy 1, out.width=950, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/untidy1.png")
```

## What's wrong?  
```{r untidy 2, out.width=950, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/untidy2.png")
```

## What would you change?  
```{r untidy 3, out.width=950, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/untidy3.png")
```

## Pivot functions  

```{r}
lotus
```


```{r lotus read}
lotus <- read.csv("../data/lotus.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select(planta, trat, doy, starts_with("tallo_"))

#pivot_longer
lotus2 <- lotus %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("tallo"),
               names_to = "rep",
               values_to = "length_cm") 
pivot_longer()

# pivot_wider

```

## Use the pivot function for other visualizations  

```{r pivot viz}
lotus_compl <- read.csv("../data/lotus.csv") 

lotus_compl <- lotus_compl %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("tallo_"),
               values_to = "tallo_cm") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-name) 
lotus_compl %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(planta, trat, doy)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~name, scales ='free')
```

## Separate a column that contains more information  

```{r separate}
# lotus example
lotus2 %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  separate(rep,c("trait", "rep"), sep="_")

# coords example
read.csv("../data/coords.csv") %>% 
  separate(coord, c("x","y"), sep = "/")

```



## Join functions     

Combine different datasets: e.g. yield with weather data  

```{r joins}
fao <- read.csv("../data/FAOSTAT_data_9-15-2021.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select(Area, crop = Item, yield = Value)
fao <- fao %>% 
  group_by(Area, crop) %>% 
  summarise(yield_avg = mean(yield))
fao_weather <- read.csv("../data/wb_weather.csv") %>% 
  mutate(Area = c("Argentina", "Uruguay", "Brazil", "Honduras"))

colnames(fao);colnames(fao_weather) 

#which countries do I have in fao
fao$Area %>% unique()

# inner_join

# left_join
soybean <- fao %>% filter(crop=="Soybeans")
fao_weather %>% 
  dplyr::select(-country) %>% 
  left_join(soybean, by="Area")

fao %>% 
  left_join(fao_weather, by="Area")

# right join

# full_join

```

## Combine columns  

```{r unite}
# FAO site-year example  (Year - Area)

```

## Work in groups  

Read the file "Data file of Heat tolerance of chickpea genotypes in thermal zone of Ethiopia.xlsx" (also, check the metadata) and then:  
**a.** Create the columns:
* "FPI" that is the Flowering-Podding Interval (i.e. the difference (in days) between 50% flowering and 50% podding); "PD", Podding duration, as the difference (in days) between start and end of podding.  
**b.** Read the file "chickpea_weather_madeup.csv" and pair each treatment with its data and create a new dataframe containing all the information, but only with the treatments that have crop data.  
**c.** Create a new dataframe that is the "longer" version of that "wide" dataframe.  
**d.** Visualize Yield versus PD, and visualize the average temperature july-september.  

**Extra and super fun:** Pick 2 treatments of your choice and make a timeline with x = days, y = treatment, and in text show the event happening at which moment. 

## Discuss  
You are working on a model to predict yield using soil, weather and crop data. You want to try the following variables to your model:  
* Yield  
* Density  
* Genotype  
* N fertilization  
* P fertilization  
* Planting date  
* Soil water content  
* Sand %  
* Clay %  
* pH  

* Precipitation (induvidual for April, May, June, July, Sept and Oct)  
* Temperature (induvidual for April, May, June, July, Sept and Oct)  

How would you arrange your data frame?  

## Wrapup  

* Tidy data saves time and preserves your (and everyone else's) mental health
